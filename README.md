# Mental Health Quiz App
This is my final project for the Google Africa Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics track. This Quiz App provides a brief overview of the current situation in the world about Mental Health. It also gives the user resources for learning more online. After that, the user has the opprtunity to fill out the survey to the best of their knowledge, submit, and then receive the results. Currently, the app is available in English (the default language) and Spanish.
